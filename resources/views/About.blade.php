						AMBROSIA Is the leading Fine Dine Restaurant In Port City Chittagong Since 2008. Ambrosia restaurant offers full flavored, full-bodied Thai, Chinese, Indian, Indonesian, Continental , Arabian and Bangladeshi dishes with a fine touch of a very special chef with competitive price. It is located in the heart of Chittagong city at the commercial area of Agrabad between ‘Port & Court’, ‘Shore & Hills’.<br/><br/>

						Ambrosia has a very nice and cozy atmosphere decorated with warm color and colonial outlook. We have facilities for arranging all types of programmes for 500-700 people, meeting, and conference and individual lunch/dinner arrangement. <br/><br/>

						In Greek mythology, the best of the men are not men but Gods. And they are not expected to have anything but the finest.<br/><br/>

						Gods’ ambrosia is sometimes the food, sometimes the drink, of the gods, often depicted as conferring ageless immortality upon whoever consumes it.<br/><br/>

						Ambrosia is of such scintillating taste that mare mortals could only dream and wonder. It is something that people desperately tried to find, to create all that makes for a great story but it contains within itself the pursuit of perfection. Food is not just a means of survival but is an experience to be savoured. And ambrosia, as the food of the heavens, is the ultimate benchmark for that experience.<br/><br/>
						
						Ambrosia is open seven days a week.<br/><br/>
